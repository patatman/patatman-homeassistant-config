## Naming convention

Zigbee naming scheme:
`<room>_<location>_<type>_<nr>` e.g. `livingroom_couch_light_1` or `office_window_sensor`

It is possible for sensor not having a Number, for instance the Office window only has 1 door/window sensor so naming should be kept short as possible. 

## Installation
First clone the repo: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/patatman/patatman-homeassistant-config.git
```
Next, edit the docker-compose file to match our enviroment. More about docker-compose here: [Docker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/)
Then move the `docker-compose.yml` file one folder up.
```
$ cp docker-compose.yml ../docker-compose.yml
```
This is needed since we're mounting the whole directory as our config.

If you'd only like to use a certain compenent, just copy the configuration to your own configuration, and create a Frankensteie config (made up of bits and pieces of everyone's configuration)

## Docker-compose Usage

<img align="right" src="./.assets/hass-docker-compose.gif?raw=true">

I like to use Docker-compose opposed to a long docker run command. Since it gives me more flexibility in restarting home-assistant. It's also easier to maintain, since it's a single file. 
Some of the basics commands you might already use with docker:
### Start the container in the foreground

```
$ docker-compose run
```   
This runs the container in the foreground, showing all TTY straight into your terminal. Handy for debugging.
To exit, hit `ctrl + c` 
<aside class="notice">
Exiting a container running in the foreground will kill it. Meaning Home Assistant will no longer be active.
</aside>

### Start the container in the background

```
$ docker-compose run -d
```  
With the `-d` parameter you send the TTY to the background. This is the recommended way of running Home Assistant, since you can use your terminal.

### Restart containers
```
$ docker-compose restart
```

### Show running containers
```
$ docker-compose ps
```

### View logs

```
$ docker-compose logs -f
```
This will open the logs, and automatically follow them(showing new entries). 
You can also send it without `-f`, this will not follow the logs.
